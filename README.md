# Print Utils

A very simple library I created to help me learn Rust. While creating a Rust CLI app for misc utils for my job, I decided to start investigating how to add color to STDOUT. I wanted to colorize the CLI text and print out messages to the user in a slow line by line fashion.

Turns out adding color to STDOUT is tricky _if_ needing to support multiple different environments, which I didn't need to. SO, this library is _not_ recommended for usage, there are better ones out there. But it was a fun project to work on!
